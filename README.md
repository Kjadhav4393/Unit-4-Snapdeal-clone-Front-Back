**Challenges**

We had faced a lot of issues in cloning the website. First of all connecting the backend to forntend was bit chellenging but after all going through many documentation we find the solution. We also gets so many syntax error every day, for this purpose we had two meeting session everyday where we all share our problems with each other to find solution. By this we all get idea about how much work is left and how much time we needs to give for completing the project.
